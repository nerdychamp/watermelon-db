WatermelonDb setup for react-native `v0.70` android non jsi

This is the demo from official watermelonDb documents refactored to worked with `react-native^0.70` and `react-navigation^6.0`.

I have further refactored to work with `use-observable` hook from [`observable-hooks`](https://observable-hooks.js.org/) package that you will find in [use-observable-hooks](https://github.com/pkrinesh/watermelon-db/tree/use-observable-hooks) branch.

## TODO
- [ ] Add my experience working with both apis.
- [ ] advantage and disadvantage.
- [ ] why withObservable hoc is better choice until official hooks.
